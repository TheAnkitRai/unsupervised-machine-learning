# Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Prediction of optimum number of clusters and representing it visually.

**This project deals with the prediction of clusters of the data points that can be formed from the given data points. This project uses unsupervised machine learning to make the prediction of clusters.**
**The clusters alongwith their centroids have been represented graphically**
